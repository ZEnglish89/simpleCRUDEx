This was created in my junior year of high school when I was first learning node.js as well as how to use Github. It is the node.js equivalent of a "hello world" program.
It is a simple program that allows a user(on localhost:3000) to add students to an invisible database, and upon entering a student's ID number and clicking "read" it will populate
the inputs with the information of the student matching that ID number.
