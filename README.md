This was created in my junior year of high school when I was first learning node.js as well as how to use Github. It is the node.js equivalent of a "hello world" program.
It is a simple CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) program running on localhost:3000, running a database of hypothetical students, who are identified, of course, by their ID numbers.
To add a student to the database, input their information, and click "create." If a student with that ID number does not exist, a "good create" will happen.
To read the data of an existing student, input their ID number and click "read." If that ID number has a student, a "good read" will happen and their information will populate the form.
To update the data of an existing student, input their ID number and new information and click "Update." If that ID number has a student, a "good update" will happen and their data will be replaced with the new data entered.
Finally, to remove a student from the "database," input their ID number and click "Delete." If that ID number has a student, a "good delete" will happen and they will be removed.
